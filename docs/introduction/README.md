# Introduction

A data lakehouse is a data platform that merges the best aspects of data warehouses and data lakes into one data management solution. If you are looking for an open-source solution for a data lakehouse, Presto is the perfect choice. Presto is a fast and reliable SQL query engine for data analytics on the open lakehouse. It has a wide variety of use cases, like running interactive/ad hoc queries at sub-second performance for your high-volume apps, or lengthy ETL jobs that aggregate or join terabytes of data. Presto is designed to be adaptive, flexible, and extensible. The plugin mechanism it provides allows you to connect to different data sources. A single Presto query can combine data from multiple sources, archiving analytics across your entire organization. Dozens of connectors are available from the Presto community today. Here is a high-level architecture diagram:

## Data Lakehouses

In order to understand the data lakehouse, we should cover the other data storage solutions that it is based upon: the data warehouse and the data lake.

* Data warehouse: a storage system where relational (row- and column-based) tables are stored in order to perform fast analytics
* Data lake: a storage system where a great deal of semi-structured (XML, and JSON) or unstructured data (files, images, time-series, etc.) is stored as-is for a relatively low cost

A data lakehouse combines the query speed and data quality of a data warehouse with the flexibility and low storage cost of a data lake. An open lakehouse has the additional benefit of being based on open technologies. A general diagram of the architecture of a data lakehouse is below.

As seen in the above diagram, Presto and Apache Hudi are open source projects that each have a place in the open data lakehouse. Let's look at where they fit in the ecosystem below.

## Presto Overview

Presto is a query engine, which is a piece of software that sits on top of the underlying data storage architecture and fulfills requests for data by optimizing the data retrieval process. More specifically, Presto is a *distributed* query engine for fast SQL-based analytics.

Presto is flexible and supports querying across diverse sources, including both structured relational databases and unstructured and semi-structured NoSQL data sources. Presto uses what it calls 'connectors' to integrate with this wide range of external data sources. Any data source can be queried as long as the data source adapts to the API expected by Presto. This makes Presto extremely flexible and extensible. Likewise, Presto supports many different file formats, such as ORC, Avro, Parquet, CSV, JSON, and more. Presto also supports a few different table formats including Delta Lake and Apache Hudi.

Presto was open-sourced in 2019 when it was donated to the Linux Foundation and is under the open source governance of the Presto Foundation. All of these reasons make it the perfect choice of query engine for an open data lakehouse.

## Table Formats

In the above section, we mentioned that Presto supports multiple file formats and multiple table formats. Let's explore the meaning of these terms more closely. A file format is just the structure of a file that tells a program how to display its contents, as specified by the file extension. For example `.txt` is a file format. In the case of a data lakehouse, there are a few different file formats that can be used to store table data. Some popular options are Avro, Parquet, and Orc.

A table format, on the other hand, is more like a metadata layer between the data files and whatever is trying to access the table that is represented by these files. A table format determines how the files that make up a table are organized and brings database-like features and efficiency to a data lake. In this way, it is a key part of a data lakehouse. Table formats support features that often aren't available on traditional data lakes, such as ACID transactions and row-level operations. The three most prevalent open table formats are Apache Iceberg, Apache Hudi, and Delta Lake. Take a look at the comparison table below:

### Apache Hudi

Apache Hudi is a fast growing data lake storage system that helps organizations build and manage petabyte-scale data lakes. Hudi brings stream style processing to batch-like big data by introducing primitives such as upserts, deletes and incremental queries. These features help surface faster, fresher data on a unified serving layer. Hudi tables can be stored on the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) or cloud stores and integrates well with popular query engines such as Presto, Apache Hive, Apache Spark and Apache Impala.

Hudi enables storing vast amounts of data on top of existing DFS compatible storage while also enabling stream processing in addition to typical batch-processing. This is made possible by providing two new primitives. Specifically:

* **Update/Delete Records**: Hudi provides support for updating/deleting records, using fine grained file/record level indexes, while providing transactional guarantees for the write operation. Queries process the last such committed snapshot, to produce results.
* **Change Streams**: Hudi also provides first-class support for obtaining an incremental stream of all the records that were updated/inserted/deleted in a given table, from a given point-in-time, and unlocks a new incremental-query category.

Hudi supports the following table types.

* **Copy On Write (COW)**: Stores data using exclusively columnar file formats (e.g parquet). Updates version & rewrites the files by performing a synchronous merge during write.
* **Merge On Read (MOR)**: Stores data using file versions with combination of columnar (e.g parquet) + row based (e.g avro) file formats. Updates are logged to delta files & later compacted to produce new versions of columnar files synchronously or asynchronously.

These primitives and tables types allow Hudi to support multiple types of queries. Specifically,

* **Snapshot Queries**: Queries see the latest snapshot of the table as of a given commit or compaction action. In case of merge-on-read table, it exposes near-real time data (few mins) by merging the base and delta files of the latest file version on-the-fly. For copy-on-write tables, it provides a drop-in replacement for existing parquet tables, while providing upsert/delete and other write side features.
* **Incremental Queries**: Queries only see new data written to the table since a given commit/compaction. This effectively provides change streams to enable incremental data pipelines.
* **Read Optimized Queries**: Queries see the latest snapshot of a table as of a given commit/compaction action. Exposes only the base/columnar files in latest file versions and guarantees the same columnar query performance compared to a non-hudi columnar table.

## Getting Started

In this workshop, you will use docker to spin up

* A Presto cluster consisting of a single server node
* A Hive metastore backed by a MySQL database
* A Spark cluster to create and populate the Hudi tables
* A MinIO s3-compatible storage instance

Without further ado, let's get started.
